# Hi, I'm Daniel 👋

I’m a machine learning engineer with a background in **chemical engineering** and **computational science**, currently leading the AI Engineering team at Atinary Technologies since Feb 2025, where we productionize cutting-edge bayesian optimization algorithms, monitor their performance and enable scalable AI experiments.

I'm passionate about AI4Science :electron: and any projects that intersect modelling, optimization, and sustainability.
