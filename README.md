# Hi, I'm Daniel 👋

I’m a machine learning engineer with a background in chemical engineering and computational science, currently leading the AI Engineering team at Atinary Technologies (since Feb 2025) [atinary-dpacheco](https://github.com/atinary-dpacheco). I work on productionizing cutting-edge Bayesian optimization algorithms, monitoring their performance, and enabling scalable AI-driven experiments.

I’m passionate about AI for Science :electron: and projects at the intersection of modeling, optimization, and sustainability.
